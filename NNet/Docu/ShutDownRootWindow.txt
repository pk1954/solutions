How to shut down a RootWindow?

1. ShowWindow(SW_HIDE) is not a shut down. THe Rootwindow continues to exist.
2. 

WM_CLOSE is send by
   - NNetAppWindow::OnCommand in response to IDM_EXIT
   - PanelPlatform::removeScan

RootWindow - WM_CLOSE
	call OnClose

RootWindow::OnClose
   calls DestroyWindow

RootWindow::DestroyWindow()
   ::DestryWindow(m_hwnd)
   m_hwnd = nullptr;

::DestroWindow (WinApi)
   Destroys the specified window. 

   The function sends 
   - WM_DESTROY and 
   - WM_NCDESTROY messages to the window to deactivate it and remove the keyboard focus from it. 

   The function also 
   - destroys the window's menu, 
   - flushes the thread message queue, 
   - destroys timers, 
   - removes clipboard ownership, and 
   - breaks the clipboard viewer chain (if the window is at the top of the viewer chain).

   If the specified window is a parent or owner window, 
   - DestroyWindow automatically destroys the associated child or owned windows when it destroys the parent or owner window. 
   - The function first destroys child or owned windows, and then it destroys the parent or owner window.

  DestroyWindow also destroys modeless dialog boxes created by the CreateDialog function.

	- no action, handled by DefWindowProc
